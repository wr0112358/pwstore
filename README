Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress. But in use and working.

Missing/Bugs
  o general:
    rethink data structure and uid.

  o x11 clipboard algorithm
    Windows equivalent?
    Provide option to copy first username, then after selection request the
    password.
    What todo in a ssh session?

  o cli:
    Disabling ECHO in termios settings has no effect.
    select instead of busy wait.

    Alternate mode does not clear the screen correctly using ssh in cygwin
    terminal.

  o point&click gui:
    python/tk + boost python?
    needs some refactoring:
      reencryption for every operation is not feasible. Move all methods
      add/lookup/.. to a class that saves the current state(=crypto file
      and db).
    display all entries per dflt
    filter entries with partial string search on user input
    select entry with double click -> copy pw in copypaste-buffer

  o windows:
    crypto backend needs RNG. see comment.
    interactive lookup not working yet. port terminal_util.hh

# first real usage revealed:

dump -o should dump pws in cleartext too

env_variable to specify default db

add -i

all of the modyfying commands should be interruptible!(lookup and x11 thingy too!)

provide bash_completion script

auto resize terminal, so that it works at least for me under awesome wm

add build instructions for windows and used deps to this file

add howto for usage:
    awful.key({ ctrlkey, }, "2", function () awful.util.spawn("urxvt256c -e /opt/usr/bin/pwstore -f DB_FILE lookup -i") end),

timeout for interactive mode, after which pw must be reentered?

print keys without "'s around it, so copy/paste is easier.

new mode for lookup, that is enabled by cmdline flag or by a command_option in interactive mode:
  copy first username and if successfull copy password!

backup files are nice, but kinda too many of them keep floating around..
  commandline flag to delete some/all.
  show changes made since a specific backup file. (history functionality)
#

Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Look at db contents/get uids:
  ./pwstore dump
  ./pwstore lookup <optional-string>
  Or do an interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Extract a password:
  ./pwstore lookup -n <uid>
  Or in interactive mode:
  <Enter> <uid> <Enter>

  Remove a key:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1
  or multiple keys:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1 -n 2

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.


Get it
  Recursive clone, to get the deps too.
  git clone --recursive <this-repo>
  make pwstore
