Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress. Not usable yet. (add and lookup works, but retrieving
the matching password does not.)


Missing/Bugs
  o x11 clipboard algorithm
    make it more user friendly. Can the opening window be suppressed?
    windows equivalent?
    provide option to copy first username, then after selection request the password.

  o cli:
    disable echo
    select
    remove need for additional keyboard input at start of interactive lookup after
    password input.

  o gui:
    python/tk + boost python?
    -> needs some refactoring

  o windows:
    crypto backend needs RNG. see comment.
    interactive lookup not working yet.


Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Look at db contents/get uids:
  ./pwstore dump
  ./pwstore lookup <optional-string>

  Extract a password:
  ./pwstore lookup -n <uid>

  Interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.


Get it
  Recursive clone, to get the deps too.
  git clone --recursive <this-repo>
  make pwstore
