Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress.

Store existing or generated passwords together with url and username
in an encrypted database.
Access to database is provided by a command line tools and through a
qt gui. Fast lookup of keys/values with partial string matching.


Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Look at db contents/get uids:
  ./pwstore dump
  ./pwstore lookup <optional-string>
  Or do an interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Extract a password:
  ./pwstore get -n <uid>
  Or in interactive mode:
  <Enter> <uid> <Enter>

  Extract a password and dump to stdout instead of x11 selection
  buffer/qt clipboard:
  ./pwstore -o get -n <uid>

  Remove a key:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1
  or multiple keys:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1 -n 2

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.


Get it
  Recursive clone, to get the deps too.
  git clone --recursive <this-repo>
  make pwstore


Installation
  su --command="make install"

  After installation it is recommended to add a short-cut key for
  interactive lookup. Examples to use C-2 as shortcut under:
  For awsome wm add to .config/awesome/rc.lua:

    awful.key({ ctrlkey, }, "2",
              function()
	      awful.util.spawn(
	      "urxvt256c -e /opt/usr/bin/pwstore -f DB_FILE lookup -i"
	      ) end),

    And restart with: META-C-r
  For openbox-lxde add to ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml:
    <keybind key="C-1">
      <action name="Execute">
          <command>/opt/usr/bin/open_shell_in_cwd_of</command>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    And restart with: $ openbox-lxde --reconfigure


Missing/Bugs
  o gui:
    show last opened db as clickable string if no db is open
    close button
    file open dialog->no or sensible filter

  o authenticity & integrity:
    integrate mac. and show info on startup: last modification, and info why this is shown.

  o general:
    Rethink data structure and uid.
    Show changes made since a specific backup file. (history functionality)
    grep -n \(void\) . *
    grep -ni todo . *

  o x11 clipboard algorithm/qt clipboard
    This won't work in a ssh session.

  o cli:
    Disabling ECHO in termios settings has no effect.
    Alternate mode does not clear the screen correctly using ssh in cygwin
    terminal.
    Interactive add is missing.
    - New mode for lookup, that is enabled by cmdline flag or by a command_option
      in interactive mode: copy first username and if successfull copy password.
      (Provide option to copy first username, then after selection request the
      password.)
    - Backup files are nice, but too many of them keep are created. Commandline
      flag to delete some/all.

  o windows:
    - Interactive lookup not working yet. port terminal_util.hh
    - Build/install instructions
    - Integrate get.bat get.PS1 as install and update scripts, that
      fetch the most recent stable version from binary server
    - Script to upload latest stable binary to server. Should also generate hashes of
      created packages and commit these hases to github. The commit containing these hashes
      should be the one marked with the version tag.

Dependencies
  o windows
    Crosscompilation for windows with: mingw32-qt5-qmake
    Windows installation see: win_install.sh
