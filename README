Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress.

Missing/Bugs
  o general:
    rethink data structure and uid.

  o x11 clipboard algorithm
    windows equivalent?
    provide option to copy first username, then after selection request the password.

  o cli:
    emacs style key bindings are not the best choice for usability..(except for emacs users)
    disabling ECHO in termios settings has no effect
    select
    alternate mode does not clear the screen correctly using ssh in cygwin terminal

  o gui:
    python/tk + boost python?
    -> needs some refactoring

  o windows:
    crypto backend needs RNG. see comment.
    interactive lookup not working yet. port terminal_util.hh


Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Look at db contents/get uids:
  ./pwstore dump
  ./pwstore lookup <optional-string>
  Or do an interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Extract a password:
  ./pwstore lookup -n <uid>
  Or in interactive mode:
  C-x n <uid>

  Remove a key:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1
  or multiple keys:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1 -n 2

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.


Get it
  Recursive clone, to get the deps too.
  git clone --recursive <this-repo>
  make pwstore
