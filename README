Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress. Not usable yet. (add and lookup works, but retrieving
the matching password does not.)


Missing
  lookup:
    dump uid of matched data.
    lookup by uid with:
      ./pwstore -n <uid> lookup
      or
      ./pwstore -i lookup
        -> C-x n <uid> <Enter>

  integrate x11 clipboard algorithm (windows equivalent?)

  integrate deps as submodules

  gui:
    disable echo
    select


Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.
