Password Storage With OpenSSL Backed Cryptography

Work in progress. But in use and working.

Missing/Bugs
  o general:
    Rethink data structure and uid.
    Show changes made since a specific backup file. (history functionality)
    grep -n \(void\) . *
    grep -ni todo . *

  o x11 clipboard algorithm/qt clipboard
    This won't work in a ssh session?

  o cli:
    Disabling ECHO in termios settings has no effect.
    Alternate mode does not clear the screen correctly using ssh in cygwin
    terminal.
    Interactive add is missing.
    Some command to dump pws to stdout in cleartext necessary?
    New mode for lookup, that is enabled by cmdline flag or by a command_option
    in interactive mode: copy first username and if successfull copy password.
    (Provide option to copy first username, then after selection request the
    password.)
    Backup files are nice, but too many of them keep are created. Commandline
    flag to delete some/all.

  o windows:
    crypto backend needs RNG. see comment.
    interactive lookup not working yet. port terminal_util.hh
    build/install instructions

Usage
  Add some data:
  ./pwstore add
  Or add some provided test data:
  ./pwstore init

  Look at db contents/get uids:
  ./pwstore dump
  ./pwstore lookup <optional-string>
  Or do an interactive lookup:
  ./pwstore -i lookup

  Extract a password:
  ./pwstore lookup -n <uid>
  Or in interactive mode:
  <Enter> <uid> <Enter>

  Remove a key:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1
  or multiple keys:
  ./pwstore remove -n 1 -n 2

  Interactive mode displays the supported keyboard shortcuts per default.


Get it
  Recursive clone, to get the deps too.
  git clone --recursive <this-repo>
  make pwstore


Installation
  su --command="make install"

  After installation it is recommended to add a short-cut key for
  interactive lookup. Examples to use C-2 as shortcut under:
  For awsome wm add to .config/awesome/rc.lua:
    awful.key({ ctrlkey, }, "2", function () awful.util.spawn("urxvt256c -e /opt/usr/bin/pwstore -f DB_FILE lookup -i") end),
    And restart with: META-C-r
  For openbox-lxde add to ~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml:
    <keybind key="C-1">
      <action name="Execute">
          <command>/opt/usr/bin/open_shell_in_cwd_of</command>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    And restart with: $ openbox-lxde --reconfigure
